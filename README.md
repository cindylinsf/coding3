# Remaking Hitchcock's 1963 film _The Birds_

[[link]] ()

This project is inspired by Joanna Zylinska's work [_The Gift of the World (Oedipus on the Jetty)_](https://www.nonhuman.photography/perception-machine), a remake of [_La Jetée_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ4jFYTTjAU).

_La Jetée_ is a 1962 French science fiction featurette directed by Chris Marker and associated with the Left Bank artistic movement. Constructed almost entirely from still photos, it tells the stable time loop story of a post-nuclear war experiment in time travel. It is 28 minutes long and shot in black and white. [1] To create this work, Zylinska generated the new script by feeding selected lines from _La Jetée_'s original script to GPT-2, which took the film in an unexpected new direction. She then combined AI methods such as GANs, Diffusion, and CLIP to produce images for the film. [2]

For Zylinska, the editing process was intuitive and consisted of her own visual and corporeal responses to both the script and the GAN images, which she references as a dream-like state, where neural networks find patterns in images not so much in a logical preprogrammed way but rather by using previous data and memories as prompts for making new connections between data points and for generating new data. In this work, she finds herself dreaming _with_ but also _against_ the AI algorithm underpinning the model. The 'counterdream' aspect was important for her given the sociopolitical limitations of AI technology, which have been well documented by feminist and decolonial cultural critics, revealing not only gender and racial bias but also the exclusionary and unjust logic underlying many of its founding principles, not to mention its extractivism when it comes to both human and natural resources. She was curious about what AI would do to the source material, but she knew she would need to step in as both a dream catcher and analyst. [3]
